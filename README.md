Predicting the buy/sell price of a car

As owners of a website that provides a platform for buying/selling of used cars, how do you help a person to sell his car with the right price tag, i.e. how do you suggest a good price to him? Because if he guesses a price himself he may estimate it too high and nobody will buy the car or he may price it too low and lose money since the car was worth more money. How can we suggest him right price/price range?
